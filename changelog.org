* v0.2.1
- do not define ~erfc~ and related functions on JS
* v0.2.0
- ~median~ does not require an argument any longer
* v0.1.19
- fix logic for ~endpoint~ in ~linspace~
* v0.1.18
- add ~asType~ to convert an ~openArray~ of some type to target type
- add ~isSorted~ argument to ~percentile~ to avoid sorting if input is
  already sorted.  
* v0.1.17
- make ~flatten~ and ~shape~ work on ~openArray~
- implement ~truncMean~ to calculate truncated means    
* v0.1.16
- do not use ~contains~ mixing ~int~ and ~set[int16]~
* v0.1.15
- check for ranges determined from data in =histogram= for valididy
  (no =NaN= or =(+-)Inf= allowed)
* v0.1.14
- fix naive implementation of =linspace= to avoid accumulating errors, sigh
* v0.1.13
- fix return type of unweighted =histogram= to specify based on a
  =dtype= argument. By default this is =int= (as we accumulate
  counts). 
* v0.1.12
- make =flatten=, =shape= work for seqs not only of =SomeNumber= types
* v0.1.11
- make =weights= and =density= arguments work for =histogram=
