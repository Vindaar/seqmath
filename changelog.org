* v0.1.13
- fix return type of unweighted =histogram= to specify based on a
  =dtype= argument. By default this is =int= (as we accumulate
  counts). 
* v0.1.12
- make =flatten=, =shape= work for seqs not only of =SomeNumber= types
* v0.1.11
- make =weights= and =density= arguments work for =histogram=
