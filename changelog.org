* v0.1.17
- make ~flatten~ and ~shape~ work on ~openArray~
* v0.1.16
- do not use ~contains~ mixing ~int~ and ~set[int16]~
* v0.1.15
- check for ranges determined from data in =histogram= for valididy
  (no =NaN= or =(+-)Inf= allowed)
* v0.1.14
- fix naive implementation of =linspace= to avoid accumulating errors, sigh
* v0.1.13
- fix return type of unweighted =histogram= to specify based on a
  =dtype= argument. By default this is =int= (as we accumulate
  counts). 
* v0.1.12
- make =flatten=, =shape= work for seqs not only of =SomeNumber= types
* v0.1.11
- make =weights= and =density= arguments work for =histogram=
